/*
  # Fix infinite recursion in user_profiles RLS policies

  1. Problem
    - Current policies are causing infinite recursion by querying user_profiles table within user_profiles policies
    - This creates a loop when trying to check user roles

  2. Solution
    - Drop all existing problematic policies
    - Create simple, non-recursive policies that don't self-reference the table
    - Use auth.uid() directly for user identification
    - Separate admin permissions from regular user permissions

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can create user profiles" ON user_profiles;
